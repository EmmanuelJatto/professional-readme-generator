# professional-readme-generator
The goal of this project was to create a professional readme generator, so that the user could enter information about their project.  The project will prompt the user and asks the user multiple questions, and then take those answers to the questions, and create a readme with these answers.  

There were many challenges that I faced while creating this project.  One of the challenges were figuring out how to format and create the readme.
